                   Modules and Abstract Data Types

Objective:

This lab practices concepts of modules, including files as modules,
signatures, and polymorphic abstract data types.

There are 4 total parts to this lab. Please refer to the following
files to complete all exercises:

   lab7_part1.ml -- Part 1: Implementing modules
   lab7_part2.ml -- Part 2: Files as modules
   lab7_part3.ml -- Part 3: Interfaces as abstraction barriers
-> lab7_part4.ml -- Part 4: Polymorphic abstract types (this file)

(*======================================================================
Part 4: Polymorphic abstract types

You may have noticed that the stack module in Part 3 focused
exclusively on int types. But this doesn't have to be so: we can also
create modules with polymorphic abstract data types, even ones
protected by a signature.

Below is a signature for a stack data structure, but providing a
polymorphic abstract type so that we can generalize stacks to be int
stacks, string stacks, stacks of all sorts. *)

module type STACK =
  sig
    exception EmptyStack
    type 'a stack
    val empty : 'a stack
    val push : 'a -> 'a stack -> 'a stack
    val top : 'a stack -> 'a
    val pop : 'a stack -> 'a stack
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 4A: Define the stack module implementation. First, decide how
you'll represent the stack, then implement each of the functions in
the signature based on your decision. You may want to look at part 3
for inspiration, but this implementation may differ from your previous
implementation based on a design choice we describe below.

We helped you out a little and defined "top" and "pop" for you,
below. These rely on a helper function called "pop_helper", which
is one you must implement. It should accept a stack and return a tuple
containing the first element and the stack with the first element
removed.

Notice that the pop_helper function does *not* appear in the
signature, and will therefore not be accessible to functions outside
of the module.

You'll want to take advantage of the EmptyStack exception provided in
the module; raise it if an attempt is made to examine or pop the
top of an empty stack.

module Stack : STACK =
  struct
    exception EmptyStack

    type 'a stack = 'a list      (* replace this with the correct
                               implementation type *)

    (* empty -- An empty stack *)
    let empty : 'a stack = []

    (* push i s -- Adds an element i to the top of stack s *)
    let push (i : 'a) (s : 'a stack) : 'a stack = i :: s

    (* pop_helper s -- Returns a pair of the front element of the
       stack and a stack containing the remaining elements *)
    let pop_helper (s : 'a stack) : ('a * 'a stack) =
      match s with
      | [] -> raise EmptyStack
      | hd :: tl -> (hd, tl)

    let top (s: 'a stack) : 'a =
      fst (pop_helper s)

    let pop (s : 'a stack) : 'a stack =
      snd (pop_helper s)
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 4B: Write a function, s, that takes a unit argument and uses
your Stack module to return a new stack with the following strings
pushed in order: "Computer", "Science", "51".
......................................................................*)

let s () =
  let open Stack in
  empty
  |> push "Computer"
  |> push "Science"
  |> "51" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 4C: Write an expression to generate a stack with the s
function, above, and pull the top element from it, naming the result
top_el.
......................................................................*)

let top_el () : string = Stack.top (s ());;
